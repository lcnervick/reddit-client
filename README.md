==============

This is a portfolio project designed to help show off basic skills in:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript ES6
* ReactJS
* Redux
* React Router
* React Testing Library / Jest
* Git/GitHub Version Control
* Markdown Formatting

## Project Requirements

>For this project, you will build an application for Reddit using everything youâ€™ve learned, including React and Redux. Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application will allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.

### Project Objectives:
1. Build the application using React and Redux
2. Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
3. Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work
4. Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
	* Wireframes
	* Technologies used
	* Features
	* Future work
5. Write unit tests for your components using Jest and Enzyme
6. Write end-to-end tests for your application
7. Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)
8. Users can use the application on any modern browser
9. Users can access your application at a URL
10. Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app
11. Users can search the data using terms
12. Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined
13. Users are shown a detailed view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item
14. Users are delighted with a cohesive design system
15. Users are delighted with animations and transitions
16. Users are able to leave an error state
17. Get 90+ scores on Lighthouse

>We understand you cannot control how media assets like videos and images are sent to the client. It is okay to have a score below 90 for Performance if they are related to the media from Reddit.

18. OPTIONAL: Get a custom domain name and use it for your application
19. OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes
20. OPTIONAL: Make your application a progressive web app

## The Plan

* Header: Simple. Logo in the middle with a 'filter' menu icon on the right.
* Filter: Will include several popular subject categories the user can use to filter results (sports, latest news, politics, etc).
* Body: By default, it will show the 'Popular' or 'Trending' feeds, loading 10 at a time until the user scrolls down 8 posts, at which point it will load more.
* Search Bar: This will live under the header. While searching, a list of 

### Deadline

This will be a side-project while handling other things, and is expected to last **three working-days** when time allows for a full day.
